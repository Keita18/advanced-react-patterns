# Handle changing the `initialOn`

This is a pretty subtle behavior and it may feel unnecessary to handle this, but
it's important that the prefix of `initial` be honored in the way we treat it
and so the `ref` is absolutely necessary.

If someone really did want to reset our component to a brand new initial state,
they could use the `key` prop to force a remount of the component.
