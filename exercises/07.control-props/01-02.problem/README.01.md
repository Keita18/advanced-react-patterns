# Control Props

In this exercise, we've created a `<Toggle />` component which can accept a prop
called `on` and another called `onChange`. These work similar to the `value` and
`onChange` props of `<input />`. Your job is to make those props actually
control the state of `on` and call the `onChange` with the suggested changes.
